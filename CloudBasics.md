# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and artificial intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”). This model allows individuals and organizations to access technology resources on-demand, without having to own or maintain physical hardware.

Traditional computing required organizations to purchase, set up, and maintain their own physical servers and data centers. Cloud computing changes this by providing instant access to scalable and flexible resources, managed by cloud service providers.

*In simple terms:* Instead of buying and managing your own computers and data centers, you rent computing power, storage, and other services from a provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS) via the internet.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- *Cost Efficiency:*  
  Avoid large upfront capital expenses on physical hardware and software licenses. Cloud services are typically charged on a usage-based, pay-as-you-go pricing model, making budgeting more predictable.

- *Scalability and Flexibility:*  
  Scale resources up or down instantly according to changing demands. This elasticity supports seasonal spikes, new product launches, and unplanned workloads without infrastructure delays.

- *Global Accessibility:*  
  Access cloud resources from anywhere in the world via the internet, enabling remote work, global collaboration, and deployment across multiple geographic regions.

- *High Availability and Reliability:*  
  Cloud providers build their infrastructure to deliver fault tolerance, disaster recovery, and data redundancy, ensuring services remain available even during hardware failures or natural disasters.

- *Focus on Core Business:*  
  By outsourcing IT infrastructure management to cloud providers, organizations can concentrate more on innovation and delivering value rather than maintaining infrastructure.

## Cloud Service Models

Cloud services are typically categorized into three main service models:

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS offers fundamental computing resources—virtual machines, storage, and networks—delivered as a service. Users gain the flexibility to manage operating systems, applications, and data while the provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure.

- *Key features:*  
  - Virtual servers instead of physical hardware  
  - Flexible storage options  
  - Networking capabilities such as Virtual Private Clouds (VPC)  
- *Examples on AWS:* EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for servers, S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storage.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides a platform allowing developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. This model abstracts hardware and operating system management, enabling rapid development.

- *Key features:*  
  - Managed runtime environment  
  - Built-in services for databases, messaging, caching  
  - Simplified application deployment  
- *Examples on AWS:* Elastic Beanstalk for application hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS delivers fully functional software applications over the internet on a subscription or usage basis. Users do not manage the infrastructure or platform; instead, they access software through web browsers or APIs.

- *Key features:*  
  - Application maintenance and updates managed by providers  
  - User-friendly interfaces accessible anywhere  
- *Examples:* Gmail, Dropbox, Microsoft 365

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Cloud
The public cloud provides services and infrastructure that are shared among multiple organizations. Resources are owned and operated by a third-party cloud provider and accessed over the internet.

- *Advantages:*  
  - Cost-effective due to shared resources  
  - Offers a wide variety of services and tools  
  - Rapid provisioning and scalability  
- *Common providers:* AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform

### Private Cloud
A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, providing greater control, security, and customization. It may be hosted internally or by a third-party provider.

- *Advantages:*  
  - Increased data privacy and compliance  
  - Customizable hardware and software configurations  
  - Isolation from other tenants  
- *Use cases:* Healthcare, banking, government with strict regulatory requirements

### Hybrid Cloud
Hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to move between the two environments for greater flexibility.

- *Advantages:*  
  - Optimizes workload placement to meet performance and security needs  
  - Enables gradual cloud adoption  
  - Supports disaster recovery and backup  
- *Example:* An organization runs sensitive applications on private cloud while using public cloud for web hosting.

## Basic IT Concepts for Cloud Beginners

### Networking
Networking forms the backbone of cloud computing. Some key concepts include:

- *IP Address:* Unique address assigned to every device on a network. Cloud resources communicate using IPs.
- *DNS (Domain Name System):* Translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling resource access via friendly names.
- *Ports:* Logical channels on a device used for network communications (e.g., port 80 for web traffic).
- *Firewalls:* Security systems that filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on rules.
- *Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):* An isolated virtual network where cloud resources run, resembling a traditional network on-premises.

### Virtualization
Virtualization technology allows one physical machine to run multiple virtual machines (VMs), each with its own OS and applications.

- *Hypervisor:* Software that enables virtualization by allocating hardware resources to VMs.
- *Benefits:*  
  - Efficient utilization of hardware  
  - Isolation of workloads  
  - Quick provisioning of new environments  

### Operating Systems
Operating systems provide the environment where applications run.

- *Linux:* Open-source OS widely used in cloud environments due to its stability, security, and flexibility.
- *Windows:* Another popular OS, especially for enterprise workloads with Microsoft software dependencies.
- *Basics to learn:* Command terminal usage, file system navigation, process management, and scripting.
