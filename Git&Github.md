# Git and GitHub Guide for DevOps Learners

## Introduction

Git is the most popular distributed version control system (VCS). It allows multiple developers and DevOps teams to collaborate efficiently, manage changes to source code, track modifications, and maintain a comprehensive history of project development. GitHub enhances Git’s capabilities with a cloud-based platform supporting collaboration, code review, issue tracking, and automation.

This guide covers foundational concepts and advanced features of Git and GitHub necessary for a DevOps professional to manage codebases, streamline workflows, and maintain quality through automation and collaboration.

## 1. Git Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

- *Repository (Repo):*  
  A directory or storage space where your project files and the entire history of changes are stored.  
- *Commit:*  
  A snapshot of project changes at a specific point in time, with a unique identifier (SHA hash) and a message describing the change.  
- *Branch:*  
  A separate line of development which allows working on features or fixes independently from the main codebase.  
- *Merge:*  
  The operation to combine changes from one branch into another.  
- *Remote:*  
  A shared version of your repository hosted on a networked server like GitHub.

### Basic Commands

- git init  
  Initializes a new Git repository in the current folder. Use this for new projects to start tracking changes.

- git clone <repo_url>  
  Creates a local copy of an existing remote repository.
  Example:git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
  - git status  
Displays the current state of the working directory and staging area, showing changed, staged, and untracked files.

- git add <file> / git add .  
Adds changes to the staging area in preparation for a commit.

- git commit -m "message"  
Records staged changes with a meaningful commit message describing what has been done.

- git log  
Shows the commit history for the repository.

- git branch  
Lists all local branches.

- git checkout <branch>  
Switches the working directory to the specified branch.

- git checkout -b <new-branch>  
Creates a new branch and switches to it.

- git merge <branch>  
Merges the specified branch into the current branch.

- git pull  
Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

- git push  
Uploads local commits to the remote repository.

## 2. GitHub Collaboration

### Creating Repositories

- Use GitHub’s web interface to create repositories, define visibility (public or private), initialize with README and .gitignore files.

### Forking and Cloning

- *Forking* creates a personal copy of someone else’s repository on your account allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project.  
- Clone your fork to your local machine to begin development.

### Branching and Pull Requests (PRs)

- Work on feature branches separate from the main branch to isolate development work.  
- Push branches to GitHub and open PRs to propose changes.  
- Peer review and feedback happen in PRs before merging.

### Issues and Project Boards

- Issues track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.  
- Use Project Boards to organize and track issue status in Kanban-style workflows.

### GitHub Actions

- Automate workflows such as testing, building, and deploying code using YAML-based GitHub Actions.

## 3. Branching Strategies for DevOps

- *Feature Branching:*  
Each new feature is developed in its own branch, merged when complete to the main branch.

- *Git Flow:*  
A model defining multiple branches such as develop, master, release, and hotfix. Structured for release cycles.

- *Trunk-Based Development:*  
Developers frequently commit to a single main branch with feature toggles managing incomplete features, promoting continuous integration.

## 4. Advanced Git Concepts

### Rebase vs Merge

- *Merge* preserves branch history and creates a merge commit.  
- *Rebase* rewrites commit history by replaying changes on top of another base branch creating a linear history.  
- Use rebase for cleaner commit history before pushing to shared branches.

### Cherry-Pick

- Apply specific commits from one branch onto another without merging the entire branch.  
- Useful for hotfixes and bug fixes.  
- Example:  git cherry-pick abc1234

  ### Stashing

- Temporarily save uncommitted changes and clean working directory.  
- Apply stashed changes later to continue work.  
- Commands:  
git stash # Save changes
git stash list # Show stashes
git stash pop # Apply and remove stash

git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 Release"
git push origin v1.0

## 5. GitHub Advanced Features

### GitHub Actions

- Define workflows triggered by GitHub events such as push, PR, issue comments. Automate CI/CD pipelines, tests, coverage, and deployment.

### Protected Branches

- Enforce rules on branches such as requiring PR reviews, status checks, and blocking force pushes or deletions.

### Codeowners

- Auto-assign reviewers for specific parts of the repository by defining a CODEOWNERS file.

### GitHub Packages

- Host container images, libraries, and package artifacts directly in GitHub along with your source code.

### Security Automation

- Utilize Dependabot for automated dependency updates and vulnerability alerting.  
- Enable secret scanning to detect exposed credentials in code.

## 6. Best Practices for DevOps

- Write *clear and concise commit messages* using imperative mood.  
- Commit frequently and logically grouped changes.  
- Regularly *pull to stay updated* and avoid conflicts.  
- Use .gitignore to exclude build artifacts and sensitive data.  
- Automate code testing and deployment with GitHub Actions.  
- Document your collaboration and branching strategies in the repository.
