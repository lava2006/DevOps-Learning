| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**    | Data with unknown or changing access patterns, auto tiering                      | 99.999999999%        | 99.9%               | Millisecond          | Lower with monitoring   |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**            | Infrequently accessed, re-creatable data stored in a single AZ                   | 99.999999999%        | 99.5%               | Millisecond          | Lowest per tier         |
| **S3 Standard-IA**            | Less frequently accessed data but needs rapid access                             | 99.999999999%        | 99.9%               | Millisecond          | Lower than standard     |
| **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** | Long-lived archive with instant retrieval                                     | 99.999999999%        | 99.9%               | Millisecond          | Very low                |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Archive data with minutes to hours retrieval                                  | 99.999999999%        | 99.99%              | Minutes to hours     | Very low                |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**   | Deep archival storage rarely accessed                                            | 99.999999999%        | 99.99%              | Hours                | Lowest cost             |

## Project Example: Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3

Amazon S3 can host a **fully static website** with no servers required, ideal for portfolio sites, documentation, or simple landing pages.

### Steps to host a static website on S3

1. **Create an S3 bucket**


aws s3 mb s3://my-static-website-bucket


2. **Enable static website hosting**


aws s3 website s3://my-static-website-bucket/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html


3. **Set bucket policy to allow public read access**


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-static-website-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}


Apply it via AWS CLI:


aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket my-static-website-bucket --policy file://bucket-policy.json


4. **Upload your static website files**


aws s3 cp ./website/ s3://my-static-website-bucket/ --recursive


5. **Access your website**

Visit: `http://my-static-website-bucket.s3-website.<region>.amazonaws.com`

## Summary

Amazon S3 is a powerful and versatile storage service with a wide range of storage classes tailored for different needs. Hosting a static website is a popular, cost-effective use case that leverages S3â€™s global availability and durability.
